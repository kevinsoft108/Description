UNDER AGENT ACCOUNT

NO PLAYERS showing under agent same issue with admin, all agent and players not showing on admin

  

I loaded points under player using agent 

Points didn’t reflect onp layer

   

It says password field is required 

Same issue with admin when admin loads agents accounts and players 


On player side

 

Please remove this  two pre-loaded tabs
Only tabs added from game control should show 


Also 

 

Change heads to word wala , and 
Tails to meron. 
Also this box should show result when “draw”, make sure that preloaded tabs are not included in this box anymore.   Make sure this portion is working according to  how the game is added (number) as well as accurate with the result. 

Also changed this box  color make it look like this  

  
  

Remove this language footer on PLAYER, ADMIN, AND AGENT ACCOUNTS

ALSO REMOVE ALL LABELS WITH WORD “NGO UNDERGROUND” change it to SIPATPH 


This is only applicable to the dev branch, we will make new branch with different logo and name (LATER). Just finish this current branch. 

 

Here the yellow indicates how much the player bets on meron or wala

Then the payout = indicates how much the player can earn after betting 

Then under the payout  in under MERON/WALA is the total of all how much all players bet on MERON and WALA. 

Please make sure the numbers here are accurate. 
















Also  on the codes please change the commission of master agents to %5 that is they earn 5% from players under them for every bet. 

For sub-agent please change the commission rate to 3% where all players under sub agent when they bet the sub agent earns 3% from every bet.  


  


Make sure commission earned is working here. You can view this part to check how it works on the cara crus repository.
